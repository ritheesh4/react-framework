1.How to clean up the boiler plate for at the begining
    1.1. Delete eteh serviceWorkder.js if we do not use cache and pwas.
    1.2. Delete the logo.svg
    1.3. Delete the index.css
    1.4. Delete App.test.js
2. Change the function in the App.js into class and put the code inside of render function.
    - Render is actually called as the lifecycle method. It runs at certain point when components
      loaded.
    - It should extend to the core react components. 
        eg: Class App extends React.Component
3. The codes are written as JSX.

JSX
----
- Returning from render looks like HTML but it is actually jsx. JavaScript syntax extention.
- JSX saves time and reduces code length.
- In JSX we should use className instead of class. Another one is for attribute. If we use for in the label, it
  has to be replaced as htmlFor.
- The entire JSX code has to be inside of a one div. So that expression should wrapped in a parent element.
- In some cases, if we don not need to wrap everything up inside of a single div, we have to use React.Fragment.
  Using this react fragment, that parent div can be skipped over.
- If I import fragment from react, again I do not need to use React.Fragment, I can directly write it as <Fragment>
- Empty brackets <> will also work but that is not a good practice to follow.
